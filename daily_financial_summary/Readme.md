This project implements a CrewAI pipeline that generates a daily US financial markets summary after market close.
It uses multiple agents (employees) to search news, summarize, add charts, translate into multiple languages, and send the report to a Telegram channel.

Summary Agent → uses litellm (local Gemini) to produce a <500 word summary

Formatting Agent → inserts [CHART1] and [CHART2] placeholders, attaches charts/images

Translation Agent → translates into Arabic, Hindi, and Hebrew

Send Agent → posts summary + charts to Telegram channel
